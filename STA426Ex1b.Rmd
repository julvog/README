```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

At first lets create those 100 random values from the normal distribution:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x<-rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd=0.25)
```

After that we figure out the exact mean and variance of those 100 random values:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
mean(x)
var(x)
```
 And now we do the exact same thing as before, with one minor change: Instead of x we take log(x) : 
```{r,echo=TRUE}
mean(log(x))
var(log(x))
```
 
## Including Plots

And in finalizing this exercise, we create the histograms for x and log(x)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(x)
hist(log(x))
```
